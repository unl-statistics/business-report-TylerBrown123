This includes (potentially) all states.\nReports from storm spotters and what the NWS considers reputable sources are submitted to the Storm Data publication by National Weather Service field offices.\nThe data is a simple CSV file with each row representing one tornado and each column being a different descriptor of the tornado.\nThe NOAA is a reputable known source for these types of data so there should be no data quality issues.\nSome suggested data analysis methods include probability estimation based on magnitude and/or distance travelled inland or towards the coast",
